# [Introduction to Fluid Simulations](https://quentinwach.com/Introduction-to-Fluid-Simulations)

>ðŸ›‘ **This is a work-in-progress and I just got started so please keep your expectations low for now!** Aside from that...


This book aims to provide an **intuitive** and _completely free_ **hands-on** introduction to fluid simulations through **practical projects**. You will learn the basics of fluid mechanics, mathematical models, and how to program your own simple simulations using [`Python`](https://www.python.org/).

The chapters are meant to be kept very short and you'll quickly have created your first project. [Start reading now!](https://quentinwach.com/Introduction-to-Fluid-Simulations)

## Summary
- [Eulerian Fluid Simulation (30%)](https://quentinwach.com/Introduction-to-Fluid-Simulations/Eulerian%20Fluid%20in%202D.html#eulerian-fluid-simulator)
  - [X] Create a close to real-time fluid simulation in Python using Numpy.
  - [ ] Get obstacles to interact with the fluid  properly.
  - [ ] Write up the related chapters.

## Contribute
I encourage you to become a contributer and co-author. I am writing this as I am learning. The outline is rough and will change almost entirely. So if you have some cool and exciting ideas and you want to chat about fluid simulations or simulations with me in general, please reach out to me here or on [X @QuentinWach](x.com/QuentinWach), or just submit a pull request!

## FAQ
>**Why are the MathJax equations written so weirdly?** The reason for this can be found in the [documentation of mdBook on MathJax](https://rust-lang.github.io/mdBook/format/mathjax.html). In short: They don't support this and I am bothered by it as well.
