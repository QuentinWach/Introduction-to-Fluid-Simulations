# [Introduction to Fluid Simulations](https://quentinwach.com/Introduction-to-Fluid-Simulations)

This book provides a free **hands-on** introduction to fluid simulations through **practical projects**. You will learn the basics of fluid mechanics, mathematical models, and how to program your own simple simulations using open-source tools (i.e. [`Python`](https://www.python.org/)).

The chapters are kept very short and you'll quickly have created your first project. [Start reading now!](https://quentinwach.com/Introduction-to-Fluid-Simulations)

## FAQ
>**Why are the MathJax equations written so weirdly?** The reason for this can be found in the [documentation of mdBook on MathJax](https://rust-lang.github.io/mdBook/format/mathjax.html). In short: They don't support this and I am bothered by it as well.
