# Introduction to Fluid Simulations

This book provides a **hands-on** introduction to fluid simulations through **practical projects**. You will learn the basics of fluid mechanics, mathematical models, and how to program your own simple simulations using open-source tools (i.e. [`Python`](https://www.python.org/)).

The chapters are kept very short and you'll quickly have created your first project.

## FAQ
>**Why are the MathJax equations written so weirdly?** The reason for this can be found in the [documentation of mdbook on MathJax](https://rust-lang.github.io/mdBook/format/mathjax.html). In short, they don't support this for whatever reason.
